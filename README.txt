About
-----

tpf-client is a low-latency audio transmission software based
on the jacktrip protocol and built in Pure Data.

It tries to overcome some limitations that are often encountered
when using the traditional jacktrip commandline utility:

 * None of the endpoints are required to have a public IP address.
   All clients can be behind a firewall.

 * The tpf-client reduces complexity when configuring a session
   with many endpoints.

The client registers itself to a tpf-server which keeps track
of the connected clients. Thus the clients learn about the other
clients and establish a jacktrip audio connection to their
peers either by routing the packets through the tpf-server or
directly to the peer by employing a technique called UDP hole
punching (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching).

The client is pre-configured to connect to a tpf-server
running on telematic.zhdk.ch (TCP-Port 3025) which is supposed
to be running anytime. The tpf-server software can be found
