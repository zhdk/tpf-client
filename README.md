About
-----

tpf-client is a low-latency multi-channel audio transmission software
based on the [AoO](https://git.iem.at/cm/aoo)  (Audio-over-OSC) protocol.

In its current version it supports sending and receiving up to 8 channel
to and from up to 8 other locations. The received audio streams are
made available on separate ports on the [JACK](https://jackaudio.org/) server
where they can be connected to an JACK-aware DAW like [Ardour](https://ardour.org/)
or an external mixing desk.

You can download the client from:

  https://github.com/zhdk/tpf-client

The server software is hosted separately at:

  https://github.com/zhdk/tpf-server


Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure to get the latest Pure Data from:

  https://puredata.info/downloads/

You need the following externals to run tpf-client
  * aoo

You can install externals through the Pd menu:
'Help' -> 'Find Externals'


Usage
-----

#### Run

To run the client, open the patch tpf-client.pd in Pure Data. Typically,
you run Pd with jack as audio backend, so that you can send audio from
and to the tpf-client to other software. When running from the command-
line, the recommended parameters are:

~~~sh
pd -rt -jack -inchannels 8 -outchannels 65 -nojackconnect \
     -jackname tpf-client -open tpf-client.pd
~~~

#### Configure

Before anything, open 'Settings' and configure the fields in the 'Connection
parameters' section. If you don't know about a server, you can run your own
(see [here](https://github.com/zhdk/tpf-server/) for details).

All parameters in the 'Audio Parameters' section take immediate effect, even
when the streaming is already running. You can either send your audio
compressed - encoded with [OPUS](https://opus-codec.org/) audio codec - or
uncompressed as [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation)
encoded.


#### Connect

The client connects to the server by clicking the top left button. Blue indicates
connection is established. Red indicates that some error occured. The name used
for each client connected to the same server must be unique. If the conncection
is successfull, other clients connected to the same room are listed in the
client rows below 'peer nodes'. To establish an audio transmission, either side
needs to initiate the connection by clicking the black square in the left and
the other side has to confirm by clicking the flashing yellow button.
Once the audio connection is established, the corresponding button turns blue
and the numbered squares indicate the number of received channels and the audio
level of each. The numbers on the channel indicators correspond with the numbers
in the QJackCtl connection dialog.


#### Transmission mode

tpf-client supports two transmission modes. The first transmits all audio data
through the server which relays streams between clients. The second mode uses
[UDP hole punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) for
establishing a direct peer-to-peer connection between two clients. Since the
peer-to-peer mode doesn't put any load onto the server and usually means lower
latency, it is the preferred mode. However, not in all network environments
it is possible to use peer-to-peer mode. tpf-client automatically detects
whether peer-to-peer mode is available for a certain connection and falls back
to server relay mode if it is not. This evaluation happens for any set of two
clients independently. When streaming to more than one peer, it is possible
that both modes are used simultaneously.
